# This Repo is for small projects 

### 1. Task Manager
- Creating tasks
- Checking them
- a date checker
- tagging tasks
- archiving
- recurring tasks
- breaking big tasks in to chunks
- (Advanced: Obsidian Integration)

Need some kind of SQL database for archiving
It needs to remember tasks so its going to need a database connection

i dont know if it should be a web app or not, maybe local is best for now

1.  Local Prototype 
2.  Web App with Django
